# Secured CoreOS Vagrant

This Vagrant Template is a clone of the minimal coreos Vagrant Template found [here](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant). 
I did extend the setup with TLS support. A description of the necessary changes can be found here: [Securing the Docker for coreos Vagrantfile template](https://ender74.github.io/Securing-Coreos-Vagrant-Docker/)
